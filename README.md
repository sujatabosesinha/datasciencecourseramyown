# datasciencecourseramyown
had to create a repo with a slightly different name because I forked one from someone who created a repo with the datasciencecoursera name from a previous class without really understanding that I was supposed to create one for myself. Now the system keeps saying that a repo with that name already exists; so I created one with a slightly different name.
